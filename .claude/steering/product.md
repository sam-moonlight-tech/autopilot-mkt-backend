# Product Overview

## Product Purpose
Autopilot is an agent-led procurement platform that replaces fragmented sales conversations and static marketplaces with a guided, conversational experience for enterprise buyers evaluating robotic cleaning solutions. The platform educates buyers, structures purchasing decisions, and generates actionable data for sales follow-up.

## Target Users

### Primary: Enterprise Buyers
- Facilities managers evaluating robotic cleaning automation
- Procurement teams researching ROI and vendor options
- Operations leaders comparing solutions across multiple facilities

### Secondary: Sales Representatives
- Use the platform to guide prospect conversations
- Leverage generated data for personalized follow-up
- Reduce explanation burden during discovery calls

## Key Features

1. **Agent-Led Discovery Conversations**: AI-powered chat that captures facility profiles, priorities, and constraints through natural conversation
2. **ROI Visualization & Recommendations**: Dynamic visualization of estimated savings and tailored product recommendations based on discovery inputs
3. **Company/Team Account Management**: Support for individual accounts and company accounts with owner/member roles for team collaboration
4. **Product Catalog with Semantic Search**: RAG-powered search enabling the agent to surface relevant products based on conversational context
5. **Conversation History & Continuity**: Full conversation storage enabling users to resume sessions and reference past interactions

## Business Objectives

- Enable sales to run full Discovery → ROI → Option Selection flows during live calls
- Reduce manual explanation burden by letting the agent handle education
- Generate structured, actionable data from buyer conversations
- Create a demoable MVP for investor presentations
- Validate the agent-led procurement concept before scaling

## Success Metrics

- **Demo Readiness**: Full flow (Discovery → ROI → Option Selection) can be demonstrated to investors
- **Sales Enablement**: Sales reps can conduct guided calls using the platform
- **Data Generation**: Conversations produce structured facility profiles and preferences
- **Flow Coherence**: Users can complete the guided journey without confusion (polish optional for MVP)

## Product Principles

1. **Agent-First**: The AI agent drives the experience; UI supports rather than replaces conversation
2. **Structured Output**: Every conversation produces actionable, structured data
3. **Sales-Ready**: Optimized for sales-led usage in MVP; self-serve comes later
4. **Rapid Iteration**: Build fast, learn fast; avoid over-engineering for hypotheticals
5. **Educational**: Help buyers understand options, not just list products

## Conversation Phases

The agent guides users through three distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Discovery
- Capture facility type, size, current cleaning approach
- Understand priorities (cost, quality, labor reduction)
- Identify constraints (budget, timeline, integration requirements)

### Phase 2: ROI Walkthrough
- Present estimated savings based on discovery inputs
- Visualize cost comparisons and payback periods
- Highlight relevant product recommendations

### Phase 3: Greenlight/Checkout
- Summarize selected options
- Identify stakeholders for follow-up
- Define next steps and action items

## Future Vision

### Post-MVP Enhancements
- **Self-Serve Journey**: Full buyer self-service without sales involvement
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Support for multiple vendor catalogs
- **Advanced Analytics**: Conversation insights and conversion tracking
- **Mobile Optimization**: First-class mobile experience
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with CRM and procurement systems
